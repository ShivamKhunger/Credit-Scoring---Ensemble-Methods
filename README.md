# ðŸ’³ Credit Scoring App - Ensemble Methods

A Streamlit web app that classifies credit risk (Good or Bad) using an ensemble model trained on the [German Credit Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)).  
This project leverages feature engineering, label encoding, scaling, and ensemble modeling to provide both single and batch credit risk predictions.
